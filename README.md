Hi, I'm Eidmanal Shomo.
I'm passionate about data analysis, cybersecurity, networking and game development, with nearly a decade of programming experience.
Over the years, I've become proficient in several languages and technologies, including:

- Java (Swing and AWT)
- C++ and C
- SQL and SQLite
- HTML, CSS (with frameworks like Bootstrap and W3.CSS)
- JavaScript (including Node.js, jQuery, AJAX, and Chart.js)

I take a hands-on approach to my projects, often designing my own icons, logos, and visual assets to maintain full creative control and cohesion.
Feel free to reach out to me at eid.manal.shomo@gmail.com
